# RFID-Based-Smart-Attendance-System
A hardware-based RFID Attendance System built using the PIC16F877A microcontroller, programmed in embedded C and fully simulated in Proteus. The system reads RFID card IDs via UART, validates them against stored records, and provides instant feedback using a 16×2 LCD and buzzer.
